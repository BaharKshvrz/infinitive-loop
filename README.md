# intersection observer API in React 

In plain english, it allows us to detect when certain elements are visible in our viewport, 
this only happens when the element meets your desired intersection ratio.


As you can see, if we scroll down the page the intersection ratio will be going up until it meets the designed threshold and that's when the callback function is executed.
